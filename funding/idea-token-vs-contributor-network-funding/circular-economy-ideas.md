# Circular economy ideas

There are a number of software projects that could benefit from trying to create a circular economy through the usage of a token. Most of these same ideas could also function by using the networks treasury funding to sustain long term development, meaning a token would not be needed.



**Software ideas**

The following ideas could create a circular economy with their own token, they could also charge fees with the networks base coin and also could have neither of these and be funded using network based incentives.

* Stablecoin's - e.g. USD token
* Security tokens - e.g. Bonds, stocks
* Real world asset tokens - e.g. Tokens that represent commodities or a house, car etc.
* Soulbound tokens - Tokens that are issued and designated to a single individual or entity and are not transferable.
* Privacy tokens - A token could wrap an existing coin from a public chain and make the transactions private.
* DeFi protocols - DEX, borrowing & lending, synthetics, derivatives, CDPs
* DAO, governance & identity tooling
* Utility software libraries - For building smart contracts, transaction builders etc
* Network infrastructure tools & libraries
* Security reviews & code audits
* Scalability solutions
* Indexers, explorers & data oracles
* Wallets



**Other non software ideas**

There are a number of non software ideas that could benefit from network treasury funding.

* Research & analysis
* Demos & onboarding
* Articles & blog posts
* Hackathons
* Contributor mentorship
* Community hubs
* Workshops & courses
* Ecosystem educational resources
* Translation support
* Standardisation efforts



**Reasons a token might be useful or necessary**

* **Token utility** - Ideas might need a token for unique use cases and functionality that they can achieve with the coin from the base network.
* **Customisation of token** - Tokens can be customised for different use cases such as how the supply changes over time, what parts of the token are immutable or mutable or a changing number of applications and environments that token could be used in.
* **Token autonomy** - Having a separate token means the project team and surrounding community for that token could have full autonomy to update and replace their token as needed for their own use cases.
