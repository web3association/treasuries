# Applying the score voting examples to these approaches

Four different parts of score voting have been compared with the different approaches that existed for that part. These comparisons focused on:

* Points allocation approaches
* Maximum proposal allocation approaches - These maximum proposal allocation approaches are only relevant to the points per decision points allocation approaches.
* Voting option approaches
* Victory condition approaches



These different approaches for score voting can be mixed and matched to create the different [example score voting approaches ](../voting-approaches/score-voting.md)that were listed in the voting approaches analysis. The score voting approach examples adopt the following approaches:

<table><thead><tr><th width="138">Name</th><th width="119">Points allocation approach</th><th width="128">Maximum proposal allocation approach</th><th width="122">Voting option approach</th><th width="94">Victory condition approach</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Approval Voting</td><td>Single point per proposal</td><td>No maximum allocation</td><td>Approval option only</td><td>Total score</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Disapproval Voting</td><td>Single point per proposal</td><td>No maximum allocation</td><td>Disapproval option only</td><td>Total score</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Balanced Approval Voting</td><td>Single point per proposal</td><td>Not applicable</td><td>Approval &#x26; disapproval options</td><td>Total score</td><td>Approval scores minus disapproval scores generates the total score</td></tr><tr><td>Score Voting</td><td>Multiple points per proposal</td><td>Not applicable</td><td>Approval option only</td><td>Total score</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Majority Judgement</td><td>Multiple points per proposal</td><td>No maximum allocation</td><td>Approval option only</td><td>Median score</td><td>Example voting options of Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor, Very Poor would be a 5 point system that names each option on the voting interface.</td></tr><tr><td>Spend Voting</td><td>Multiple points per decision</td><td>Not applicable</td><td>Approval option only</td><td>Total score</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Average Voting</td><td>Multiple points per proposal</td><td>Not applicable</td><td>Approval option only</td><td>Average score</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Median Voting</td><td>Multiple points per proposal</td><td>Not applicable</td><td>Approval option only</td><td>Median score</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cumulative Voting</td><td>Available positions single points per decision</td><td>No maximum allocation</td><td>Approval option only</td><td>Total score</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Quadratic Voting</td><td>Multiple points per decision</td><td>Quadratic allocation</td><td>Approval option only</td><td>Total score</td><td>The cost of each additional vote for a proposal increases quadratically. This makes it less effective to consolidate points in one proposal.</td></tr><tr><td>Conviction Voting</td><td>Multiple points per decision</td><td>No maximum allocation</td><td>Approval option only</td><td>Total score</td><td>The duration of time that points have been allocated to a proposal will influence the final score they receive.</td></tr><tr><td>Weighted Voting</td><td>Multiple points per decision</td><td>No maximum allocation</td><td>Approval option only</td><td>Total score</td><td>Voting power is influenced by things like share options which gives larger shareholders more voting power in a decision.</td></tr><tr><td>STAR Voting</td><td>Multiple points per proposal</td><td>Not applicable</td><td>Approval option only</td><td>Total score</td><td>This approach also adds an automatic runoff process as well.</td></tr></tbody></table>
