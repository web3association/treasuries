**Overview**

Everyone is given a single point they can allocate per proposal. This will often represent their entire voting power that they can use on any proposal decision.



**Low accuracy & expressiveness (Score - 2)**

Voters would be able to vote on any of the proposals that they prefer and allocate a point towards them. This gives the voter some expressiveness to indicate which proposals they prefer but does not enable them to express the intensity of their preferences. The other concern with this approach is around the accuracy of the outcome as it doesnâ€™t force the voter to select the most important proposals. Instead voters could simply decide to approve every proposal that they want to.



**Very low voting complexity (Score - 5)**

The voting process would be the same for every single decision which makes the voting process simple. Only having one point to allocate means the voting process remains simple. Every voter would get the same experience within a given decision and with any future decisions.



**Very low voting time required (Score - 5)**

There is only one point to allocate and voters would become familiar with the approach. This approach would keep the time required to participate to a minimum.



**Very low game theory risks (Score - 5)**

Bad actors would not get any benefit from diluted voting power as every voter would apply the full voting power on each proposal they approve. Certain voting behaviour would not give these bad actors more influence over others beyond the influence of their own voting power.



**Total score = 17 / 20**
