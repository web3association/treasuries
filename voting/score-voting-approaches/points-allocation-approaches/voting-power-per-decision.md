**Overview**

Each person's voting power would determine the amount of points they receive to allocate.



**Moderate accuracy & expressiveness (Score - 3)**

Some voters could be restricted in how they can express their preferences if the number of points is determined based off someone's voting power. Some voters could have far less voting power than others. One benefit of this approach is the simplicity for finding out how much influence a voter has over a decision based on the amount of points, equivalent to their voting power, they have to allocate. If a voter had a small amount of voting power they might not be able to split their points across multiple proposals, where as someone with a large amount of voting power points could be far more expressive with how they allocate their points across many proposals. A disparity in voting power could be problematic for decreasing some voters ability to express their preferences in enough detail compared to the voters who have more voting power.



**High voting complexity (Score - 2)**

The main issue with the voting power determined points allocation approach is the experience would be different for each voter as each voter would likely have a different amount of voting power. Voting power can also change over time so someone's own personal voting experience would also be changing as their voting power changes. This can add some complexity to the voting process as the voter now needs to recalibrate how they allocate their points in each decision based on what their voting power is at that given point in time.



**Moderate voting time required (Score - 3)**

Someone with very little voting power would need less time to allocate their points as they wouldnâ€™t have as many points to allocate. Someone who has a very large amount of voting power may need to spend a larger amount of time considering exactly how they want to distribute their points. A very large number of points to allocate means the voter would have a lot of influence and also could be more precise and expressive about how they want to allocate those points. The time required to vote would vary and likely increase on average as the number of points someone is allocating is increased. It should be noted that the voters with the largest voting power could decide to over allocate to a small number of their own preferences in a short period of time and not spend a lot of time considering the other options in much depth!



**Moderate game theory risks (Score - 3)**

If this approach adopts a fixed maximum allocation approach it would mean that the consolidation of voting power across a number of proposals would not give bad actors an increased influence. Bad actors could benefit from voting behaviours where voters dilute their voting power by allocating their points across more proposals than there are fillable positions. Not allocating points up to the maximum limit could mean bad actors get an advantage by always consolidating their voting power on their own proposals to increase their influence over the decision.
