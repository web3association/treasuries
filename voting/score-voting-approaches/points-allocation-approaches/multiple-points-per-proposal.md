**Overview**

Everyone is given the same number of points to allocate to each proposal. The points allocation is a single fixed number. It is not based on the information about the voter, their voting power or any other part of the proposals or decision. Example points allocations could be 5 points, 10 points or 100 points.



**High accuracy & expressiveness (Score - 4)**

Having multiple points means voters will be able to express the intensity of their preferences. All voters will also get the same experience. The lower the number the less the expressiveness but the lower the complexity. The main concern with this approach is that it could reduce accuracy outcomes as the voter is not required to compare proposals to decide how they want to allocate their points. They could allocate the full amount of points on each and every proposal. This is good for expressiveness but could come at the cost of reducing accuracy in selecting the most promising proposals.



**Low voting complexity (Score - 4)**

The voting process would be the same for every decision and for every vote meaning this approach is easy to learn and use repeatedly. Having larger numbers would slightly increase the complexity of allocating the points however not by a large amount.



**Low voting time required (Score - 4)**

Voters would become familiar with the number of points they can allocate so this would help with reducing the time it takes for voters to participate in each decision.



**Moderate game theory risks (Score - 3)**

Bad actors could benefit from voting behaviour where voters dilute their voting power by only using some of their allocated points on a proposal rather than their full voting power. This behaviour could help to increase the voting power of bad actors as they can benefit from always using their full voting power on any of their proposals.



**Total score = 15 / 20**
