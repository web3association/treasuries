# Points allocation factors for consideration

The [methodology](../../../analysis/approach-comparison-methodology.md) used for this approach comparison is documented separately.



**Accuracy & expressiveness**

* **Description** - Decisions need to have accurate outcomes and voters want to be able to express their exact opinions and preferences.
* **Importance score** - 5, Very important. A loss in expressiveness and accuracy can lead to decision outcomes that do not fairly represent the preferences and opinions of the voters. Poor voting approaches could also prevent important information from being shared that could better inform future decision making.
* **Scoring questions -** How does the points allocation approach impact how voters are able to express their exact preferences and opinions? What accuracy in outcome could this lead to?
* **Scoring** - High accuracy & expressiveness is good (Score - 5). Low accuracy and expressiveness is bad (Score - 1).



**Voting complexity**

* **Description** - The number of points a voter has to allocate can influence the complexity of the voting process.
* **Importance score** - 5, Very important. Increases in voting complexity could lead to a reduction in participation. Voters might not have enough capacity to vote on many proposals if the complexity is too high.
* **Scoring questions -** How complex is it for a voter to make a decision with the points allocation approach? Does the decision complexity change as the number of points to allocate increase or decrease?
* **Scoring** - Low complexity is good (Score - 5). High complexity is bad (Score - 1).



**Time required to participate**

* **Description** - The number of points a voter has to allocate could influence how long it takes for a voter to become familiar with a voting process and also how long it takes them to vote in each decision.
* **Importance score** - 5, Very important. Reducing the time required to participate in voting will be very important for maximising the amount of people that can feasibly participate due to their own time constraints. The larger the number of voters there are, the more important this factor becomes.
* **Scoring questions -** How long would it take for someone to participate and allocate their points in a decision? What happens if there are many decisions that use this approach?
* **Scoring** - Low time required is good (Score - 5). High time required is bad (Score - 1).



**Game theory risks**

* **Description** - Voters could use their allocated points in a way that gives bad actors an advantage in the voting process. The differences in how people vote could create opportunities for bad actors to gain an advantage in the decision process.
* **Importance score** - 5, Very important. Making a robust voting process at scale will need to think about how it can prevent bad actors from abusing the voting process due to how they can allocate their points when voting and how they can take advantage of people's voting behaviours.
* **Scoring questions -** How could bad actors take advantage of the voting process based on how different voters may behave? Could bad actors be given an advantage if people vote in a certain way?
* **Scoring** - Low risk is good (Score - 5). High risk is bad (Score - 1).
