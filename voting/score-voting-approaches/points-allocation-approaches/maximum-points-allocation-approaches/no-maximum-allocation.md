**Overview**

No maximum allocation means voters can allocate all of their points on one proposal or across multiple proposals. The voter is able to allocate their points exactly as they want to.



**Very high accuracy & expressiveness (Score - 5)**

Voters can allocate their points exactly as they want to whether thatâ€™s equally across a number of proposals or incremental amounts over different proposals. This approach is the most expressive as it gives voters full control over how they allocate their points. In terms of accuracy the main issues with this approach is it does not encourage people to vote on enough proposals that would mean filling the available positions. This may or may not be a problem as it would depend on people's voting behaviour in aggregate.



**Very low voter complexity (Score - 5)**

This approach is very simple for voters to understand as they are given a number of points and they simply allocate them towards any proposals they prefer.



**Low time required (Score - 4)**

Voters can allocate their points allocation exactly how they want to across the proposals they prefer. This allocation of points would represent their entire voting power so it will be easy for them to utilise all of their points regardless of how they decide to vote as long as they allocate their points.



**Very high game theory risks (Score - 1)**

Normal voting behaviour could often include people that vote on many proposals that they prefer. This behaviour dilutes their voting power across multiple proposals and gives bad actors a potential advantage where they can consolidate their voting power on one proposal or a small handful of proposals to give themselves the highest probability of influencing the decision outcome. Bad actors could achieve increased influence in many decisions using this simple strategy of consolidating the points they can allocate.
