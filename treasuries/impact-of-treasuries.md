# Impact of treasuries

Treasuries have a multitude of ways in which they can impact people's lives:

* **Income** - People can often rely on treasuries to receive their income. Nation state, corporation and Web3 ecosystem treasuries all have many contributors that can rely on the income they receive from their ecosystems treasury.
* **Economic stability & growth** - The decision of where assets get allocated can have a big influence on the stability and growth of a community. Effective treasury management with impactful capital allocation can give any nation state, corporation or Web3 ecosystem a competitive advantage over competing communities.
* **Taxation policies** - Taxation can impact people's income, investment returns and cost of living. Taxation policies are often set or influenced by the treasuries for both nation states and Web3 ecosystems. For nation states this could mean changing income or capital gains tax, whereas for Web3 networks this could mean changing transaction fees.
* **Access to capital** - How capital is being managed by nation states, corporations and Web3 ecosystems will directly impact which initiatives will have access to capital. Treasuries influence whether there is equal access to capital and what purposes and initiatives are able to receive any funding.
* **Risk mitigation** - How a treasury is managed will influence how effectively a community is able to respond to sudden adverse events such as economic turmoil or natural disasters. Good treasury management involves risk management that helps to better forecast the possibility and implications of these types of events. Risk mitigation will involve creating a plan for how the ecosystem can respond to these types of events if they occur.
* **Product & services availability** - How treasury funds get disbursed will impact the products and services that end up being available for the ecosystem. For nation states this can mean determining what public services and infrastructure gets funded, for corporations this can mean what new products, services and improvements get created and provided and for Web3 ecosystems this could mean what network upgrades, open source software or new applications get developed.
* **Public goods funding** - Treasuries can often play an important role in funding public goods that can generate large amounts of impact for society. Example public goods could include developing open source software, creating educational resources or scientific research, maintaining and improving biodiversity, infrastructure or air quality amongst many others.
