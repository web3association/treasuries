# Definition, purpose & responsibilities

**Treasury definition**

Treasuries are used for managing the assets of nation states, corporations, organisations and communities. Treasuries handle how assets are deposited, stored and disbursed.



**Purpose of a treasury**

Each ecosystem that manages their own assets through a treasury can have very different intentions and goals on what they want to achieve when managing or disbursing their assets. Some ecosystems may just have the goal of making the treasury sustainable, where they want to maintain or grow the value of assets in the treasury. Others can be more mission driven, where they instead are looking to direct assets towards suitable initiatives that help them achieve that mission, which could be for a commercial purpose or for creating a public good.



**Responsibilities of a treasury**

* **Asset management** - Treasuries will usually be responsible for the management of the cash, debt, capital structure and investments of an ecosystem. Cash management involves ensuring there is enough liquidity for an ecosystem to meet its short term obligations and also mean forecasting future cash flows and balances. Debt management involves handling nay short or long term debts and responsibly managing any debt levels. Capital structure management involves determining what the optimal mix is of debt and equity for the ecosystem at that point in time. Investment management involves managing how any surplus of assets are invested to earn a return or if invested could help with addressing any ecosystem priorities. How effectively assets are managed across these areas will highly impact the overall sustainability and growth of an ecosystem over the long term.
* **Risk management** - Treasuries that are responsible for other peoples assets will often need to manage any existing or emerging risks involved. Risk management can involve how accounts and transactions are secured and handled as well as dealing with external risks such as inflation, foreign exchange risks or any economic changes amongst others. Part of risk management will involve planning for these risks ahead of time and preparing accordingly so that treasury assets are well protected.
* **Compliance with regulation** - Ecosystems accepting any form of income and disbursing assets to fund different initiatives will be responsible for ensuring that those activities comply with any regulations that are applicable to the jurisdictions they operate in. Managing regulatory concerns will include looking at existing and future policies of these nations and then supporting any internal efforts to ensure that the treasuries operations comply with these regulations.
