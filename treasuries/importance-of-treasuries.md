# Importance of treasuries

**How treasuries impact peoples lives**

Treasuries have a multitude of ways in which they directly and regularly influence peoples lives:

* **Income** - People often rely on treasuries to receive their income. Nation state, corporation and web 3 ecosystem treasuries all have many contributors who are reliant on the income made available through the disbursement of the treasuries assets.
* **Economic stability & growth** - The decision of where assets are disbursed to from a treasury will have a big influence on the stability and growth of a community. Effective treasury management with impactful capital allocation can give any nation state, corporation or web 3 ecosystem a competitive advantage over competing communities.
* **Taxation policies** - Taxation can impact peoples income, investment returns and cost of living. Taxation policies are often set or influenced by the treasuries for both nation states and web 3 ecosystems that have their own currency. For nation states this could mean changing income or capital gains tax, where as for web 3 networks this could mean changing the protocols transaction fees.
* **Access to capital** - The vast scale of capital being managed by nation states, corporations and web 3 ecosystems combined directly impacts what initiatives and people get access to capital. These treasuries will determine whether there is equal access to treasury assets and what purposes and initiatives can receive any funding. A key question to ask for how these treasuries under management is whether the outcomes of these treasuries are beneficial to the wider community involved or only a select few?
* **Risk mitigation** - How effectively a treasury is managed will influence how a community is able to respond to sudden adverse events such as economical turmoil or natural disasters. Good treasury management will mean doing risk management to better forecast the possibility and risks of these types of events and creating a plan for how an ecosystem can respond to those events if they occurred.
* **Product & services availability** - The decisions made by treasuries on how funds are disbursed to certain initiatives will influence what products and services are available to the involved community. For nation states this can mean what public services and infrastructure gets funded, for corporations this can mean what new products, services and improvements are created and provided and for web 3 ecosystems this could mean what network upgrades, open source software or new applications are made readily available.



**Opportunity for improving treasury systems**

Improving the systems and processes used by treasuries represents a massive opportunity for improving society. Two key opportunities include:

* **Economic stability, growth & efficiency gains** - There are trillions of dollars in value being managed in treasuries across nation states, corporations and web 3 ecosystems. Even small percentage improvements in how these treasuries are managed and disbursed results in billions of dollars of opportunity for efficiency improvements.
* **Impactful initiatives & public goods** - Treasuries ultimately exist to help the communities that own and operate them. Better management of treasuries represents an opportunity to more effectively align efforts and capital towards initiatives that create impactful outcomes and that are for the public good. Effective treasury systems can help with the creation of more egalitarian approaches to provide more equal and fair access to capital and opportunities.
