# Opportunities & concerns

**Web3 opportunities for improving treasury systems**

Blockchain and distributed ledger technology provide a number of opportunities for improving how treasuries are developed and operated. Many of these improvements could lead to increases in economic stability and treasury efficiency. Efficiency gains could reduce costs or increase growth or the amount of funding that an ecosystem has available for funding public goods. Even small percentage improvements in how these treasuries are managed and how funds get disbursed can represent a massive return on investment for growing Web3 ecosystems. Some example opportunities include:

* **Transparency & accountability** - Using blockchain and distributed ledger technology the transactions and assets owned by a community can be stored on a transparent public ledger system. This makes it easier to see how funds are being stored and disbursed, helping to increase the amount of transparency and accountability. Community members can track and verify how funds are spent which helps to increase stakeholder trust in these emerging treasury systems and processes.
* **Removing intermediaries** - Blockchain and distributed ledger technology can help with eliminating the need for intermediaries to manage and distribute treasury assets, this helps reduce costs and custody risks and can also help with increasing process efficiencies.
* **Reducing fraud and corruption** - The immutability of blockchain and distributed ledger technology means that once a transaction is recorded, it can't be altered. This becomes a deterrent to actors who are considering committing acts of fraud and corruption due to this ability to more easily track how funds have been used.
* **Reducing transaction costs -** For treasuries involved in international transactions, blockchains and smart contracts deployed on top of these networks can help with providing faster and cheaper cross-border transfers compared to traditional banking systems.
* **Easier auditing** - Having treasury transactions stored on a public ledger means that auditing and oversight can happen as soon as funds are disbursed, which helps with spotting any irregularities sooner so they can be investigated and resolved.
* **Automated smart contracts** - Treasury operations such as payments or contractual agreements could have their funds disbursed automatically through the use of smart contracts. Conditions for distribution can be built into the contracts. Payments can also become more timely and require less manual oversight for disbursement. Automated liquidity management could also help with increasing the effectiveness of applying risk management strategies that help to protect treasury assets.
* **Improved data access & management** - Making all treasury transactions available on a public ledger will make it easier to access the data about the treasury, such as current available assets and any trends in how those assets are being used. This data can then be used to create better financial reporting and forecasting tools that could guide future decisions.
* **Decentralised decision making** - For communities that want to increase the amount of participation in treasury decision making, a blockchain can help with providing a scalable and tamper proof solution for facilitating and storing any votes on chain when executing any governance decisions.
* **Inclusive decision making** - Enabling an entire community to participate in treasury decisions will help with making a more representative process for capturing the preferences and opinions of that community. Open and transparent voting systems mean it will be easier for anyone in the community to verify the results from any treasury decision.
* **Improved identity management** - Self sovereign identity (SSI) could help with providing evidence about who has received funding from the treasury, this could help with reducing any identity duplication or fraud. SSI can also help with enabling people to take ownership of their data and have control over who is able to access that data. Zero knowledge (ZK) proofs can also help with improving treasury management by enabling private voting mechanisms for governance decisions.
* **Increased system robustness** - Centralised systems are a single point of failure for many existing treasury systems. A decentralised ledger means that the data and transactions are stored and distributed across multiple nodes that help to the network. This creates a system that is more resilient than centralised systems that could have localised failures or disasters.
* **Improved security** - Security around treasury management can be improved through the adoption of cryptographic techniques to handle how assets get managed and disbursed. Reliable security will still mean that contributors involved in a treasuries operation will need to follow best practices when developing and improving any treasury systems and whilst securing their own private keys.



**Concerns for emerging Web3 treasuries**

* **Volatility -** Cryptocurrencies have historically been very volatile, the value of the total assets under management for different Web3 treasuries can change fairly quickly. This factor makes it more difficult to execute effective financial planning and risk management. As these ecosystems continue to mature and grow this problem should reduce over the long term.
* **Governance complexities** - Increasing the amount of participation in treasury decisions can help with making these systems more representative of a communities preferences and opinions. However there is also an increased amount of complexity with governance for the treasury when more people are involved. Treasuries need to identify simple and effective governance solutions that will enable these systems to scale to a larger audience of voters. Being able to delegate voting power to other people will likely play an important role in developing longer term solutions.
* **Voter apathy** - Decentralised ecosystems can be effective for inviting a larger amount of voter participation in key treasury decisions, however this participation relies on the interest and willingness of the community to engage in governance. Creating solutions that are effective for decision making but that do not overburden the voter will be an essential part of developing decentralised decision making systems that can effectively scale.
* **Lack of historical data** - As Web3 treasuries are still a new trend there is a lack of data on how they perform and behave in different environments. This lack of data and history makes it more complex over the short term to identify trends and effectively manage Web3 assets.
* **Security concerns** - Which stakeholders have the ability to disburse treasury assets and how private keys are handled create an ongoing concern for how treasury assets are securely handled. As these emerging treasuries grow in value these risks and any potential vulnerabilities will need to be resolved to prevent any significant loss from occurring.
* **Centralisation concerns** - There is an ongoing risk that influential stakeholders with large amounts of coins could have an excessive amount of influence over these emerging Web3 networks and the decisions that get made. Democratic decentralised networks are currently difficult to implement at scale due to the threat of sybil attacks.
