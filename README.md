**Treasury knowledge resources**

These resources have been created to bring together research and analysis about treasury systems to create insightful and actionable information for learning about treasuries and the increasing amount of opportunities and possibilities. A key intended outcome for creating these resources is that the information is useful for anyone interested in learning about treasuries and is actionable for those who are developing treasury systems for their own ecosystems. These resources will have a focus on web 3 development opportunities and implementation possibilities however this same information should be useful for anyone learning about or working on improving existing treasury systems.



**Treasury knowledge as a public good**

These resources are provided as a public good for the benefit of any nation, organisation or emerging web 3 community. The goal for these resources is to help provide free and open access to insightful and actionable information about the current state and potential improvement opportunities for treasury systems.



**Current contributors**

The Web 3 Association is the first main contributor who will be supporting the creation and ongoing improvement of these resources.
